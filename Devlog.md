# Session 1 — Oct 21, 6:35 PM
Goal: Understand project & create initial structure

I spent this session rereading the PDF carefully. The project is similar to the first one (Driver + Logger + Encryptor), but more complex since it requires multiple independent interactions using only semaphores. I decided to keep the project in one Python file (bank.py) but organize the code differently than before.

Created the GitHub repo, added the Devlog, and made the basic file with constants and imports.
